Paul says if Christ was not raised, then our faith is in vain. Tracing this back, why did Jesus rise? To prove He was and is God after He died. Why did He die? To save us from the debt we owe to God for transgressing His holy nature, in a word: sin.

Here’s the clincher: if Jesus paid the debt we owed as a gift to us, then we just need to accept it, but in order to accept it we must admit to ourselves and others that there was a personal debt owed to God and want to change from who we were and what we once did.

Who likes to admit they’re wrong?

As a matter of fact, it’s harder than that. The only price that could be paid for this kind of debt was our life – the wages of sin is death. If Jesus paid this enormous price for us, which cost Him His life and unbearable torment (which was not only physical, but torment at every level of His being\[body, mind, will, emotions, spirit\]).

If this is true, then _we owe Him our lives_.

But is it true?

## Sin &amp; Repentance

Let’s start at the beginning with the first questions: are we sinful? or have we transgressed God’s will by hurting Him, ourselves and others? Why should we be sorry for our sin?

In order to answer this, we must first understand about God.

#### The Nature of God

We must understand that God is powerful (omnipotent), eternal (timeless), intelligent (omniscient), spirit (immaterial) and all present (omnipresent). Everything that this this universe He is outside of.

His nature is also the foundation of many things; for example, love, truth, justice, logic and wisdom are fundamental to walk in this world with success. These kinds of unchanging attributes are not simply something that God does, but it’s who He is – He cannot be otherwise. Let me give an example…

You may have heard the mind-bending questions such as: could God create a rock so big that even He couldn’t lift it? The idea of a question like this is that whether the answer is yes or no, then He can’t be all-powerful.

The problem is that part of God’s nature is logic and it logically impossible to anything to be created beyond his ability or power. Just like He can’t create round squares or one-sided sticks, it’s logically impossible.

You may say, but wait… that’s a limitation on God, which means that He’s not all-powerful. This is a misunderstanding of what all-powerful means.

All-powerful does not mean that He can do anything your imagination can come up with. All-powerful has to do with sovereignty, meaning that He holds authority over everything in all of creation.

Quick note: this is not an exhaustive list of God’s nature and attributes – just a few to give you an idea.

#### So, What’s the Problem with Sin?

Because God is the creator of our existence – all that we see, hear and enjoy – because we could not be here, enjoy anything or experience good (love, logic, justice) without Him, we owe Him our lives and praise.

Let’s say you were impoverished with no home, no money, no hope – then one day a man came up to you and said “I would like to bless you with every resource you’ll ever need on a daily basis.” He sets you up in a home with money, food and even connects you with people for positive relationships.

What would think if you took that food and let it rot, ate it all at once or threw it all outside to go to waste?

What if you took that money and used it to hurt/kill others, yourself or the one who gave it to you?

What if you abused the people in your life, manipulated them to get what you want or treated them with disdain and disgust?

You would have nothing if it wasn’t for this person. You owe him everything, then you turn around with those same resources for evil purposes, even to hurt or kill the one who gave them to you.

That’s sin.

It’s mistreating the people and resources that God put in our lives for our own purposes and gain rather than to glorify the one who gave them to you.

Even if you don’t believe in God, it doesn’t change the truth of His creation and if He is the creator, then you have nothing without Him.

## Jesus

So then if we owe this massive debt to God, then how could we ever pay it? Short answer: we can’t. We can’t even stop sinning long enough to try in most cases.

When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, “Then who can be saved?”

> When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, “Then who can be saved?” But Jesus looked at them and said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
>
> <cite>Matthew 19:25-26</cite>

So, what hope do we have? Our hope is that God sent His son as a sacrifice who willingly gave Himself so that we could be saved from the clutches of despair and death.

> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this dying body? <sup> </sup>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am a slave to the law of God, but with my flesh, to the law of sin.
>
> <cite>Romans 7:24-25</cite>

So there’s just three questions we need to know: did Jesus live? did He die? did He rise?

If these three are true, then it is logical to give Him your life.
