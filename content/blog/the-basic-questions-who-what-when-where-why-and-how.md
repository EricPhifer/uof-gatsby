I’m expanding primarily on what, how and why because _who_ is simple – I’m studying the triune God, which includes God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit of God.

_Where_ and _when_ are slightly deeper, [Deuteronomy 6:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6%3A7&version=HCSB) comes to mind.

> Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
>
> <cite>Deuteronomy 6:7</cite>

This is talking about teaching the commands of God to your children – of course, speaking to the Israelites – but I take it in principle for when we should learn.

Pastor Jimmy Evans brings up a good point in [A Mind Set Free](https://store.marriagetoday.com/products/a-mind-set-free-book) that these times – when we’re not doing anything in particular, when we’re traveling, when we lie down to sleep and when we first wake up – are when we’re most vulnerable to straying thoughts. So during those times especially are the best times to fill them with God’s word.

Ultimately, when is up to you, me and our respective schedules.

### What should we study?

What is the most important thing to know and understand? Of course, the obvious place to go is Jesus advising of the greatest commands: love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength and the second is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.

Love is so hard to grasp though, even with the guide of [1 Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=HCSB), Jesus’ example and the Apostles’ example. It’s still really difficult.

I get the impression sometimes that we should just _know_ as believers and followers of Christ’s word, but that just makes me feel bad about what I do feel and makes me question the very foundation of truth, my motivations, my will and my understanding. This doesn’t seem beneficial to dwell on.

The key here is to not remain stationary or complacent, waiting for magical imbuing of power and understanding, but instead to learn and understand. Stay in pursuit of Christ and His heart through the Biblical narrative.

Now I can’t say this without explaining two things: one, there is more learning than just book knowledge – there is also relational learning. Our God is living and active and loves to be in relationship with you. Of course, pursue this relationship tempered with understanding from the Bible.

Second, I am not talking about the disciples waiting for the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem after Jesus ascended. They were told clearly and specifically to do that. By and large, though, we as followers are called to “go” more than “stay”. Maybe I’ll delve into that more later.

I’m inclined to say “there’s really no wrong answer”, but I don’t think that is true. Clearly some things are given far greater importance than others in the Bible, so above all else stay within the Biblical text while remaining vigilant to not stray into <span title="abandoning a religious or political belief or principle."><span class="has-inline-color has-pale-pink-color">apostate</span></span> thinking.

So, what is the most important thing to learn?

There are much more than one answer, but I’m starting with [a post about 2 Peter 1:5-8](https://understandingoffaith.com/2-peter-15-8-why-its-so-important/).

### Why am I studying 2 Peter 1:5-8 first?

Put simply, I chose to start here because of verse 8: “For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ”.

If these are qualities the Bible tells me will keep me from being useless or unfruitful, then I think this is a perfect place to begin because that is my greatest fear. Verse 5 starts with [faith](https://understandingoffaith.com/faith-the-list-in-scripture/) at the beginning of a list of qualities to seek after, so it was the natural place to begin.

I explain more fully in the article I just mentioned above if you want to read more.

### How should we learn?

Always starting, learning and finishing with the Bible. It’s so complete that if you take the whole of scripture it will explain itself in every way I’ve found.

Also, I’ve set a goal to learn each quality listed in these verses before the end of the year.

I think it’s important to balance between hard facts and story. There are many stories going in this blog: my own, of course, as study and learn what the Biblical text says about many topics. The story of the Bible will be throughout these articles, of course. I hope you’ll share some of you story here too. Comment below and tell me what methods you use to study and learn.
