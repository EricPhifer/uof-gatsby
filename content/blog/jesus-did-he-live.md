#### How Do We Verify the Historical Existence of an Individual?

#### Non-Biblical Sources of Evidence

Non-Biblical sources can be broken into three categories: evidence sources of little value, sources of some value, and sources of significant value. Here I am outlining from _Evidence that Demands a Verdict_ by Josh &amp; Sean McDowell.

Evidence sources of little value:

- Rabbinic Tradition
  - The _Toledot Yeshu_ is the most significant work as a rabbinic account of Jesus’ life. It says that Jesus was born out of wedlock, grew up disrespecting Jewish leaders, mastered magical powers to gain a following and that Jesus’ body after death was stolen from the tomb and found again.
  - The problem with _Toledot Yeshu_ is how late it is as a source, having not been compiled until the 5th century.
  - It’s also unclear a number of times if the rabbinic text is even referring to Jesus, some trying to argue that references to Ben Pandera, Ben Stada and Balaam are actually references to Jesus, but there’s simply no evidence to support these claims.
  - Finally, even when it seems clear that this text is referring to Jesus there is indication that it’s dependent on earlier Christian claims or anti-Christian propaganda. For instance, Jesus is claimed to be the product of a tryst between Mary and a Roman Soldier named Panthera, but this name appears to be a play on the Greek word for virgin (_parthenos_), which errs on the side of this being no more than an attack on the Christian claim of a virgin birth
  - \[These are three points in _Evidence that Demands a Verdict_ referring to _The Jesus Legend_ by Greg Boyd and Paul Eddy.\]
- The Qur’an
  - The Qur’an shows Jesus as a miracle worker, who brings signs, speaks as an infant to establish himself as a prophet from God and affirms the virgin birth.
  - However, it also claims that Jesus was not God, rejects the idea of the trinity and denies that Jesus died at the crucifixion.
  - The conclusion is that the Qur’an affirms the historical Jesus, but it was written and compiled much later than the New Testament (AD 653) which makes it much too late to have any reliable independent information about Jesus. Also, since it denies the crucifixion of Jesus which is widely affirmed to have taken place, it brings into question any claim it makes about Jesus.

Evidence sources of some value:

- Suetonius
  - A Roman historian under the emperor Hadrian, Suetonius refers to Jews that cause disturbances by the instigation of Chrestus in _The Deified Claudius_.
  - One problem is that the word for Christ is Christus, not Chrestus, so did Suetonius make a spelling error or is he referring to someone else? Well Chrestus was a name used at the time, but not among Jews, only Gentiles. Suetonius likely misspelled it because of the familiar and customary spelling, but there’s no agreement among scholars for this.
  - Suetonius also refers to Nero’s fire in AD 64 and the punishment for Christians, so at very least we have a non-Biblical text that affirms Luke’s writing in Acts about the expulsion of Jews by Claudius.
- ## Pliny the Younger
- ## Lucian of Samosata
- ## Thallus
- ## Celsus
- ## Mara bar Serapion

Evidence sources of significant value:

#### Sources of Evidence &amp; the Extraordinariness of Jesus

The most obvious sources of evidence are the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John (known as the Gospels); however, the rest of the New Testament refers to Him as well.

What is truly astounding is that even the Old Testament points to Him.
