What does faith mean in scripture?
----------------------------------

There are a lot of thoughts and ideas about what faith is and what it means to us as believers: isnâ€™t blind faith the best faith? is faith opposed to science? faith is believing without evidence, right?

Ultimately our source of definition must come from God through His Word, not the shifting sands of what we or culture think. So this is my deep dive to understand what the Bible says about faith. what does the word mean and how does it work?
