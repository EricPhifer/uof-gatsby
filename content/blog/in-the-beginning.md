What happened in the beginning?
-------------------------------

What happened at the beginning and how does it impact us? Is the Earth young or old and does it matter? Why was Eve tempted? Why was Satan allowed in the garden? What was the effect of that decision? If God created Adam &amp; Eve perfect, why did they sin?

This topic is massive and covers many, many subjects. We’ll take them one at a time here from God’s first utterance to the fall of mankind.
