Are we in a Battle?
-------------------

[Ephesians 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph+6&version=ESV):12 says that our battle (or wrestle) is not against flesh and blood, but against “evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realms”. So what does that mean? Does this enemy really attack us? If so, how do we defend ourselves?

This looks to be a long one to understand and very controversial, but I will try with every post to only go where scripture leads me. Ready for battle?
