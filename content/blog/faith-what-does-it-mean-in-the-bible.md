I think it’s important to start this question with the culture first. Here in America at this time there is a common belief that “blind faith is the best faith”. The scripture most often cited to uphold this view occurs after the resurrection when Jesus is talking to Thomas. The reference occurs in [John 20:24-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A24-29&version=HCSB).

Strong’s Concordance uses the KJV for reference, so here are the relevant words from that version: **believe** (v. 25), **faithless** (v. 27), **believing** (v.27) and most of all **believed** (twice in v. 29).

Believe and believed are **_pisteuo_** (pist-yoo-o) in the Greek and means:

> from 4102; to have _faith_ (in, upon, or with respect to, a person or thing), i.e. _credit_; by implication to _entrust_ (especially one’s spiritual well-being to Christ): — believe (-r), commit (to trust), put in trust with.
>
> <cite>Strong’s Concordance, Greek 4102</cite>

Faithless is **_apistos_** (a-pis-tos; 571) in the Greek and is defined as:

> from 1 (as a negative participle) and 4103; (action) _disbelieving_; i.e. without Christ; _faith_ (specifically _a heathen_); (passive) untrustworthy (person), or incredible (thing): — that believeth not, faithless, incredible thing, infidel, unbeliever (-ing).
>
> <cite>Strong’s Concordance, Greek 571</cite>

Believing is **_pistos_** (4103) in the Greek and means:

> from 3982; object – trustworthy; subject – trustful; — believe (-ing, -r), faithful (-ly), sure, true.
>
> <cite>Strong’s Concordance, Greek 4103</cite>

Just for good measure, this is the definition for 3982, **_peitho_**:

> a primitive verb; to convince (by argument, true or false); by analogy, to purify or conciliate (by other fair means); reflexive or passive, to assert (to evidence or authority, to rely (by inward certainty; — agree, assure, believe, have confidence, be (wax) confident, make a friend, obey, persuade, trust, yield.
>
> <cite>Strong’s Concordance, Greek 3982</cite>

Here’s the question, then: is the Bible referring to “blind faith”? Using the definitions from the original language, let’s try replacing faith with other related words.

Blind trust, blind confidence, blind assurance, blind obedience, blindly persuaded.

Did the disciples trust blindly? Were they persuaded blindly? No. Time and time again Jesus gives “[many convincing proofs](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A3&version=HCSB)” or evidence proving that He is/was the Messiah spoken of by the prophets.

Even starting Mary, mother of Jesus, before he’s born an angel comes to her and tells her she’s going to have a son and then he makes it falsifiable. In other words, he offers evidence that you know this is true because Elizabeth is also going to have a baby. [Mary immediately heads out to verify the claim](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A26-45&version=HCSB).

For the paralytic that’s lowered through the roof, Jesus says “[so you may know the Son of Man has authority on Earth to forgive sins](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9:6&version=HCSB)“. He provides proof that He is God (because only God can forgive sins) by healing the man (something else that only God can do).

When Jesus first calls Peter, Andrew, James, John, He offers [a miraculous catch of fish](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5&version=HCSB) as proof of His divinity. How do we know it was meant as proof? By Peter’s reaction: “Go away from me, because I’m a sinful man, Lord!” Peter would only have called Jesus Lord and responded in this way if he was convinced through this act of Jesus’ divinity.

There are many more, but the greatest act of proof Jesus provided was by [declaring before the fact that He would suffer and die, then be resurrected](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn+2%3A18-22&version=HCSB) on the third day. This is the linchpin proof that Jesus was, is and always will be God, who walked among us.

Even after He’s resurrected, as we see in Acts, Jesus still provides “many convincing proofs” that [He is risen](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A6&version=HCSB), that [He is not a spirit, but has a body](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A42-43&version=HCSB), and that [He is still the same Jesus they knew before death.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A11-18&version=HCSB)

There’s an awesome resource regarding this [interaction with Thomas by Timothy Keller](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/timothy-keller-sermons-podcast-by-gospel-in-life/id352660924?i=1000472623336), I recommend giving it a listen.

#### Belief &amp; Faith are Nearly Indistinguishable in the Greek from One Another

The difference between belief and faith simply comes down to how it is used in a sentence. Faith appears to be used in the sense of ongoing trust that leads to action, belief is the outworking of seeing &amp; hearing (specifically in Christ most often), in other words, trust is the outworking of that seeing &amp; hearing.

#### So What is Faith According to the Bible?

Faith is trust acquired through evidence (through knowledge &amp; experience) – seeing &amp; hearing who God is and through this seeing and hearing we gain confidence in God’s character and the reality of His Biblical truth.

Faith is not merely emotion and it is not merely head knowledge. It is encompassed by understanding who God is, His attributes, His actions, His emotions and His thoughts. If we know then, from this seeking and learning, what God has been like then **we can know what He _will be_ like** also.

### Back to 2 Peter

So how does this fit back into 2 Peter? The first attribute listed is faith, or trust by way of evidence to convince us. I don’t think faith was first by accident. I believe it is foundational to Christianity but, based on this and [the resources here](https://understandingoffaith.com/faith-the-list-in-scripture/), in order to gain that faith, we must be thoroughly convinced of the truth that [first _we are sinners_, second _want to change_ and third _Jesus lived, died and rose again_](https://understandingoffaith.com/sin-repentance-jesus-the-foundation-of-christianity/) in order to save us from that sin.

I believe that we as believers should understand _<span class="underline"">everything</span>_ we can possible know related to these three things. If we are thoroughly convinced of these 3 things, we can then move on to 2 Peter 1:5-8 to grow in the sanctification of Christ.

After this confident trust in Christ, it must be supplemented by goodness. So what is goodness in the Bible? I’ll cover that next.
