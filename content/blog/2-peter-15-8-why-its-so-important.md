> <sup>21 </sup>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. <sup>22 </sup>On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ <sup>23 </sup>And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’

It’s a terrifying thought for believers isn’t it? At the end, you finally meet the man and God you have sought for – he looks at you and says “stay away from me”. If you’re like me, that hurts just thinking about it.

Did you know, though, that there’s a scripture that shows us how to not be one of those people?

> <sup>5 </sup>For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge, <sup>6 </sup>knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness, <sup>7 </sup>godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. <sup>8 </sup>For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Verse 8 hit me hard when I first read it: “they will keep you from being useless”. Maybe you don’t, but I have felt useless for the better portion of my life and this felt like God saying to me, “here’s what you do and I guarantee you won’t be useless”.

I also immediately thought of Matthew 7. I don’t want to practice lawlessness, I don’t want to be useless in the Kingdom, I need to know Jesus. Here’s the answer:

Make every effort to supplement your faith (what is faith?)

with goodness (what is good in God’s eyes?),

goodness with knowledge (what does the Bible say about knowledge?),

knowledge with self-control (how can we control our selves?),

self-control with endurance (how do I persevere in the hardest times?),

endurance with godliness (how can I act like God?),

godliness with brotherly affection (what does affection mean and how is it different from love?),

and brotherly affection with love (what does love even mean?).

These are the steps, the questions, the direction of pursuit to be a fruitful follower of Christ Jesus, Savior of mankind.

This is the introductory post for this series of posts on this topic.

First up – what is faith?
