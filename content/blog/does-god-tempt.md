Thoughts from the Evidence
--------------------------

My suspicion is that the KJV usage of tempt is using an archaic definition, so I looked into it and found this:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://i0.wp.com/understandingoffaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-17-at-8.19.19-PM.png?fit=640%2C200&ssl=1)</figure>Clearly this is the case. Knowing this, I think it’s safe to say, even translating from the Greek, that **God does not tempt us** in the common definition of the word. God does test us, though.

But wait, what about Mt 4:1, which is Jesus being lead by the Holy Spirit into the desert to be *tempted*?

What do we do with that? Well, I would first call upon the work of Greg Koukl and ask the question, “so?”.

Jesus is lead by the Spirit of God to where Satan will be in order to be tempted by him. What’s wrong with that? I suspect you may say “isn’t this God indirectly tempting us?” or “why would God lead us into danger?”

I think there are several answers to this, like Jesus was fulfilling prophecy, making himself vulnerable and identifiable to us, etc.

It really comes down to two things, though.

First, in order to be tempted, Jesus had to desire what he was being tempted with – food, to be known as Messiah and to take back authority over the Earth. All of these, were of course traps because it’s always lies and traps with the enemy. In the current definition of tempt, it is *always a temptation toward evil*. Even when it seems good, it’s always a deception – like Eve, she saw the fruit was good for eating and so gave into the deception.

Second, God is the Creator of everyone and everything you know, even the things we made are made from material He made. From rocks and metal to carbon and hydrogen. If He chooses for one of us to go through trials, then that is His right as our Creator.

But God’s nature cannot be forgotten in this and He is the standard of everything good. Nothing can be right or good unless He says it is.

If you’ve ever been through a horrible situation and thought “Oh, why me God?”, please don’t forget that Jesus suffered a horrific death for your sake. He was beaten, tortured, mocked, spat on, insulted, betrayed, abandoned and nailed to a heavy wooden cross.

Why? For you.

If He can endure for the sake of God’s plan and glory, then so can you. Find comfort in His truth, wisdom and love because He cares for you much more than you know.
