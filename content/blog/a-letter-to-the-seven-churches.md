Wake up Church! The hour is at hand. The Lord of Heaven’s Armies is close. We have known the Lamb and He does, has and will always love us; however, the Lion of Judah is returning. To those he loves he also rebukes and disciplines. (Rev. 3:19)

Jesus speaks to seven churches of the day, which clearly equate to seven different types of churches in the end times: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea. Each church he tells what they’re doing well and warns them of what areas to **repent**.

These are the warnings:

You’ve abandoned the love you had at first (Rev. 2:4)

**What to do about it:**

Remember how far you’ve fallen: repent, and do the works you did at first.

**Consequences of not listening:**

Jesus will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.

You hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a **stumbling block in front of the sons** of Israel: to **eat meat sacrificed to idols** and to **commit sexual immorality**. (Rev. 2:14)

You hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. (Rev. 2:15)

\[Teaching of the Nicolaitans refers to the blending of cultures, where – in this case – the Church looks no different than a club or self-motivation group.\]

**What to do about it:**

Repent. (Stop these practices, turn away from them and practice the things of God.)

**Consequences of not listening:**

Jesus will come quickly and fight against you with the sword of His mouth.

You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives My slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat meat sacrificed to idols. (Rev. 2:20)

**What to do about it:**

Repent and turn from the practices taught by false teachers (Jezebel).

**Consequences of not listening:**

Jesus will throw you onto a sickbed and kill all “her children” with a plague. (Children of the false teacher.)

 You have a reputation for being alive, but **you are dead**.(Rev. 3:1)

Have not found your works complete. (Rev. 3:2)

**What to do about it:**

Be alert and strengthen what remains.

**Consequences of not listening:**

Jesus will come like a thief and you will be blind to the signs of His coming.

 You are neither hot nor cold. You are lukewarm in your faith. (Rev. 3:15)

You say “I’m rich; I have become wealthy, and need nothing.” and you don’t know that you’re wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. (Rev. 3:17)

**What to do about it:**

Buy from Jesus gold refined in the fire, white clothes and ointment for your eyes.

(Clearly metaphors referring to spiritual riches of the **work of Christ** \[caring for the poor and in need while spreading the gospel\], clothing to cover your shame which is the **work already done by Christ** \[salvation at the cross\] and ointment, which is the **truth of Christ** that opens our eyes \[the gospel is foolishness to those who don’t understand (1 Cor. 1:18), but God’s truth can still be found in the world in objective moral law\].)

**Consequences of not listening:**

Jesus will reject you from His mouth (literally, “I am going to vomit you out of My mouth”).

All scripture is effective for teaching, rebuke, correcting and training in righteousness. (2 Tim. 3:16)

I want you, Church, to see these warnings and please take them seriously. Jesus is clearly very serious about them and we must be vigilant. We must be uncomfortable. We must be ready with our lamps trimmed and burning brightly for the bridegroom is returning very soon.

I want to remind you of the Words of God, what you do with it is up to you, but I urge you to repent because we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rm. 3:23). Without the work of Christ our works are like filthy rags to God (Is. 64:6, Rm. 3:10).

**Encouragements of Christ to the Church:**

There are two churches that Jesus does not rebuke: Smyrna and Philedelphia. All churches He encourages in some way. Here are those encouragements:

**To Ephesus:**

> Yet you do have this: you hate the practices of the Nicolaitan, which I also hate. Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. – Rev. 2: 6-7

**To Smyrna:**

> I know your tribulation and poverty, yet <u>you are rich</u>. I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. <u>Don’t be afraid</u> of what you are about <u>to suffer</u>. Look, the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and <u>you will have tribulation</u> for 10 days. <u>Be faithful</u> until death and I will give you the crown of life.
> 
> …The victor will <u>never be harmed by the second death</u>.
> 
> – Rev. 2: 9-11(underlining added)

**To Pergamum:**

> I will give the victor some the <u>hidden manna</u>. I will also give him a<u> white stone on the stone a new name </u>is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.
> 
> – Rev. 2: 17 (underlining added)

**To Thyatira:**

> I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who <u>do not hold this teaching</u>, who haven’t known the deep things of Satan — as they say — <u>I do not put any other </u><u>burden</u><u> on you</u>. But<u> hold on</u> to what you have until I come. The victor and the one who keeps My works to the end: <u>I will give him authority over the nations</u> —
> 
> ‘and He will shepherd them with an iron scepter; He will shatter them like pottery — just as I have received this from My Father.’
> 
> I will also give him the morning star.
> 
> – Rev. 2: 24-28 (underlining added)

**To Sardis:**

> But you have a few people in Sardis who <u>have not defiled their clothes</u>, and they will <u>walk with Me</u> in white, because they are worthy. In the same way, the victor will be <u>dressed in white clothes</u>, and <u>I will never erase his name from the book of life</u>, but will <u>acknowledge his name before My Father</u> and before His angels.
> 
> – Rev. 3: 4-5 (underlining added)

**To Philadelphia:**

> I know your works. Because <u>you have limited strength</u>, have <u>kept My word</u>, and <u>have not denied My name</u>, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close. Take note! I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying — note this — I will make them come and <u>bow down at your feet</u>, and <u>they will know that I have loved you</u>. Because you have <u>kept My command to endure</u>, I will also <u>keep you from the hour of testing </u>that is going to come over the whole world to test those live on the earth. I am coming quickly. <u>Hold on to what you have</u>, so that no none takes your crown. The victor: I will <u>write on him the name of My God</u>, and the <u>name of the city of My God</u> — the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God — <u>and My new name</u>.
> 
> – Rev. 3:8-12 (underlining added)

**To Laodicea:**

> Listen! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone <u>hears My voice</u> and <u>opens the door</u>, I will come in to him and <u>have dinner with him, and he with Me</u>. The victor: I will give him <u>the right to sit with Me on My throne</u>, just as I also won the victory and sat down with My Father on His throne.
> 
> – Rev. 3: 20-21

There are two main things I want to bring attention to in these encouragements. First, the type of people that Jesus commends:

- Hear my voice
- Cannot tolerate evil
- Allows Jesus into his/her life (opens the door)
- Have not denied His name
- Kept His word
- Limited strength
- Kept His command to endure
- Walk with Him
- Not defiled their clothes
- Don’t hold to false doctrines
- Rich in the spirit, despite tribulation &amp; poverty
- Suffer for Christ
- Hate the ways of evil &amp; false worldviews

Second, are the rewards Jesus gives:

- Have dinner with Jesus
- Sit with Him on His throne
- Write on him the name of God, new Jerusalem &amp; new name of Jesus
- Keep from the hour of testing (this clearly doesn’t apply to all Christians)
- They will know that I have loved you
- Dressed in white clothes
- Make false followers bow at your feet
- Never erase your name from the book of life
- Jesus will acknowledge your name before the Father &amp; angels
- Give you the morning star
- Authority over the nations
- Put no other burden on you (only to specific believers)
- Give you some of the hidden manna
- Give you a white stone with your new name, which only you will know
- Never be harmed by the second death
- The right to eat from the tree of life

Revelation is a book filled with metaphor. In order to understand what the Bible means by them we should always look to the Bible to define the concepts (for instance, morning star, hidden manna, white stone, etc.). I may get into these in a future post, we’ll see.

So repent – turn back to Jesus. Hold nothing higher than Him. Eternity is close. We may suffer &amp; endure trials, but as Paul says “our momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17) and “look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18).

**<u>Let all you do be for Christ &amp; Christ alone.</u>**
