## No One Knows the Day Nor the Hour

The end. Is it important for us to know? [No one knows the day or the hour](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24:36&version=ESV), that is clear. At the same time, God did give us prophetic words concerning the end times. If he provided these in His word, shouldn’t we understand them? He provides for us regarding the signs of the last days when we should be looking up with expectancy for the Lord’s return.

So what are we looking for? What are the signs? What will the end look like? What are the most popular theories regarding these verses? Where will the church be throughout these last days? Why should we know what’s to come and how much should we pursue understanding it?
